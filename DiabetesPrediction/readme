# Diabetes Prediction using Gradio

This project implements a simple web interface for predicting diabetes in patients using Gradio. The predictive model is based on logistic regression and trained on a diabetes dataset.

## Overview

The main components of this project include:

- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.

- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data processing, model training, and the Gradio app.

- `logistic_regression_model.joblib`: Saved model file using joblib.

- `README.md`: This documentation file.
